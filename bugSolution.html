To solve this issue, we'll employ a more structured approach to responsive styling:

```html
<div class="flex sm:grid md:flex lg:block">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

By applying the classes starting with the most specific breakpoint (largest) down to the least specific, we ensure that the correct styling is applied based on screen size.  Alternatively, consider using a single class for each responsive state:

```html
<div class="sm:grid md:flex lg:block">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This offers better organization and clarity, making debugging easier.  For more complex scenarios, consider using Tailwind's `@apply` directive to manage and consolidate class assignments more effectively.
