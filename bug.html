This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with complex responsive designs.  I have a component with multiple responsive classes that conflict and the wrong styles are applied.  For example:

```html
<div class="md:flex lg:block sm:grid">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

Depending on the screen size, different classes take precedence, sometimes resulting in unexpected layouts or styles.  The problem is not immediately obvious due to Tailwind's utility-first nature, making debugging challenging.
